Danny van Kooten
==================

Programmer with experience working with C, Rust, Go, Python, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Bash, HTML and CSS. I'm passionate about making software more sustainable. For me, that means that whatever I work on should ultimately contribute to less (embodied) energy, more freely shared knowledge and the empowerment of disadvantaged groups.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Danny](https://www.dannyvankooten.com/) and I am a programmer from the Netherlands. I'm pretty comfortable writing PHP, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, C, Bash SQL, HTML and CSS.

I am currently mostly working on [Koko Analytics, a simple, lightweight and privacy friendly website analytics plugin for WordPress](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/).

You can find some of my code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dannyvankooten?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) or [here on SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~dvko).

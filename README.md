### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Danny](https://www.dannyvankooten.com/) and I am a programmer from the Netherlands. I'm pretty comfortable writing Go, Rust, SQL, Bash, PHP, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I'm passionate about web performance and accessibility and do my best to make the web a little more efficient through my work.

Currently, I am spending most of my time working on [Koko Analytics, a simple, lightweight and privacy friendly website analytics plugin for WordPress](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/).

You can find some of my code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dannyvankooten?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) or [here on SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~dvko).
